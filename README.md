 Insurance Package Selection

This is a insurance package selection application, that allows a user to select a insurance package from a presented list . This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

I have used the bootstrap css and react-bootstrap for this app. 

## Criteria

```
GIVEN a user is using a insurance package picker to select a package
WHEN the user open the app
THEN the available insurance packages are displayed at the top of the page
WHEN the user hover over a package
THEN he/she is presented with a background color change of the package
WHEN the user clicks anywhere on a given package
THEN the background color of the package is set to light green to show that it is selected
WHEN the user fill in the email, age and gender fields
THEN the submit button is enabled
WHEN he/she click the submit button
THEN the selected insurance package and the user data is saved in json record
THEN the saved json data is submitted to www.example.com website
THEN the selection events persist
```
The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Also install react-bootstarp

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
